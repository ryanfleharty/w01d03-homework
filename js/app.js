//Arrays, Loops, and Conditionals

//Easy Going
//1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

//Get Even
//1. Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

for (i = 0; i <= 200; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
